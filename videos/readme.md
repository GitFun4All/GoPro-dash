GoPro Video File (MP4)

  
Put a single GoPro video MP4 file here to add the overlays to,
or a GoPro video MP4 file and corrosponding GPX file if available.

e.g.

GP10402.MP4         <- Source Video File


GP10402.GPX         <- GPS data

If the GPX file is not present and a supported GoPro MP4 contains the GPX data,
it will be created and used automatically.

Then remove this file and run your prefered command.
